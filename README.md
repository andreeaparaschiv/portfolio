# Hi, I'm Andreea!

I'm a MSc Business Analytics student at the University of Exeter looking for remote work opportunities with a UK/EU company. Although I'm based in the UK, I'm a Romanian citizen so I have the right to work in any EU/UK locations without requiring visa sponsorship. I am also available to work anytime after the 6th of June 2023.

My portfolio showcases my skills as a business analyst and contains the following entries:
- Exploratory Data Analysis of the Titanic Dataset: Using Python, I analysed the data on the passengers on the Titanic to determine which factors were most closely associated with survival and then built a predictive model. This project requires the 'Exploratory Data Analysis of the Titanic Dataset.ipynb' and 'train.csv' files to run.
- Report on Interactive Dashboard Design Process: Using R and Tableau, I created an interactive dashboard which can serve as a tool for individuals who are looking to rent a property in Barcelona. This project (including the link to the dashboard) can be found in 'Report on Interactive Dashboard Design Process.pdf'.
- Coming soon: SQL project

If you're interested in working together, I'd love to hear from you! You can reach me at andreeaprs@icloud.com or connect with me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/alina-andreea-paraschiv-632b0018a/)).
