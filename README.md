# Hi, I'm Andreea!

I'm an MSc Business Analytics student at the University of Exeter looking for remote work opportunities with a UK/EU company. Although I'm based in the UK, I'm a Romanian citizen so I have the right to work in any EU/UK locations without requiring visa sponsorship. I am also avaiable for work anytime after the 6th of June 2023.

My portfolio showcases my skills as a business analyst. I have experience working with SQL, R, Tableau, and Python, and I'm always looking for new challenges to take on. 

If you're interested in working together, I'd love to hear from you! You can reach me at andreeaprs@icloud.com or connect with me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/alina-andreea-paraschiv-632b0018a/)).
