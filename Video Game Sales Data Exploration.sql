/*Data Exploration of Video Game Sales in SQL */

/* The video game industry has experienced rapid growth and innovation in recent years. As competition intensifies, understanding market trends and 
consumer preferences becomes increasingly crucial for businesses in the sector. In this project, I analyze the "Video Game  Sales with Ratings" dataset
to uncover insights that can help businesses make informed decisions in game development and marketing. The dataset contains information on video game 
sales, platforms, publishers, genres, and critic and user ratings. By exploring this data, I will provide valuable information for strategic decision 
making in the video game industry.*/

/* Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings 
Before starting the analysis, I deleted the columns irrelevant to this exploration in Excel and then split the document into two different files: 
ratings.csv and video_game_sales.csv.*/
